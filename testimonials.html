          <p class="lead">"Sarah Helt has helped me deal with my neuropathic pain in both legs better than any medication my doctor prescribed. That includes morphine and oxytocin, which I use to take every four to six hours. I believe her breathing techniques and call for calmnest to be the greatest asset I have now in dealing with these issues. I cannot thank Sarah enough for helping me with these issues, she has been a godsend to me and I have never looked backed. She will be deeply missed by me and I couldn't think of where I would be without her. Thank you Sarah! "</p>

          <p class="lead">"Good Morning Sarah, I am happy and grateful to know you. Your classes are my favorite part of going to Yoga Loft, and when I see you are teaching, I always try to make it out.  Your classes challenge, but they are also joyful, fun, and funny, because you infuse each class with such great energy, and knowledge! I feel so fortunate to have you guide me through my practice, and yes, when I think of you being gone, it is like losing a dear, good friend.You have such talent and generosity, and love. "</p>

          <p class="lead">"I first experienced Sarah (and I use the word "experienced" for a reason - her classes are certainly more than just a regular yoga class) a year and a half ago. After practicing with her as my teacher for the first time, you immediately know that you are in the hands of someone incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about what she is leading your body through. During this time of what seems like a yoga-craze and when you really can't be sure of whether or not your yoga teacher knows much about the human body, taking Sarah's class is one of the most reassuring things you can do as a practitioner. She challenges you mentally and physically, but in a safe and thoughtful way. I have taken both her yin and power yoga classes, and I recommend them both without hesitation. Her inner light and energy combined with her outer-performer come together to give you an extremely fulfilling class."</p>

          <p class="lead">"I was seeking spiritual guidance for a Yoga teacher, when I recently moved to Chicago.  I searched different studios to continue my spiritual journey.  I did not find the teacher who would lead a class with passion, till I was introduced to Sarah's class at Yoga Loft. The moment I entered the class I felt a lot of comfort, that led me to surrender my thoughts and be present in the moment.  Sarah was keen it gently adjust the postures of all the students, so they benefit without overdoing.  Sarah's restorative class has a very unique healing effect, that restore harmony within all the organs of the body and with ease connect to the soul. I see Sarah as a passionate healer and I highly recommend her class for those who seek peace and harmony for body mind and spirit."</p>

          <p class="lead">"Sarah was one of my first yoga teachers, and she has inspired my practice immensely. She has a great energy that cannot be replicated, and at the same time she is genuine and speaks from the heart. As a beginner, I learned so much about alignment and breathing from her, which established a great foundation, but she also encouraged me to experiment and play so I could find my own practice. I'm very appreciative and thankful for all she's done to guide me on my journey and help me develop my practice, and I would enthusiastically recommend her as a yoga teacher for anyone who asks."</p>
